This tutorial shows how to exchange information between servers and
clients. The example uses a bi-directional communication. Clients
notify their server when their ping pong pad moves. Servers notify
clients when the ball moves.

The tutorial is decomposed in three steps.

  1. Implement the basic graphical parts.
  2. Handle two pads moves.
  3. Add the ping pong ball and game management.
